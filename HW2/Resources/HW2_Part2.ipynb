    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has undeniably shifted the paradigm in the realm of natural language processing, offering capabilities that inch closer to human-like text understanding and generation. Among the vanguards of this shift is the Llama-2 model, a behemoth trained on diverse text corpora, promising adeptness in various NLP tasks. However, as we usher into this era of seemingly intelligent machines, a pertinent question arises - do these models truly understand the text, or do they merely excel in retrieving memorized pieces of information from their training data? This inquiry is not merely academic; the implications of the findings reverberate through the practical applications and the future trajectory of LLMs. In exploring the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, a noteworthy investigation was carried out by [Saparov and He](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=qFVVBzXxR2V). Their analytical journey led to the revelation that these models, to a significant extent, harness the knowledge acquired during the pre-training phase when confronted with reasoning tasks. Characterized as \"greedy reasoners,\" these models exhibit a propensity to rely on the reservoir of memorized information, as opposed to showcasing authentic reasoning abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our exploration is set against the backdrop of the SQuAD dataset, a well-regarded benchmark in the question-answering domain. The choice of SQuAD is motivated by its structured evaluation metrics which offer a tangible measure of a model's ability to retrieve and reason over text. While SQuAD has been instrumental in driving progress in question answering, its conventional usage may not fully expose the nuanced capabilities of models like Llama-2. This homework aims to delve deeper by constructing adversarial datasets that challenge the model beyond mere retrieval, probing its ability to reason and refer to the provided context accurately. Through a systematic evaluation on both the original and adversarially-modified versions of the SQuAD dataset, we aspire to dissect the retrieval and reasoning prowess of Llama-2, shedding light on the model's strengths, weaknesses, and the path towards more robust and interpretable LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by setting up our workspace and loading the Llama-2 model to explore its capabilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "Evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on question-answering tasks necessitates employing metrics that accurately reflect the models' ability to provide correct and precise answers. Two widely acknowledged metrics for this purpose are Exact Match (EM) and F1 Score, which offer a lens through which the accuracy and the overall quality of the model’s responses can be gauged.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exact Match (EM)**:\n",
    "   - The Exact Match metric measures the percentage of responses that match the ground truth answers exactly. It is a stringent metric that requires the predicted answer to be identical to the ground truth answer.\n",

    "$\\text{EM} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of exact matches}}{\\text{Total number of questions}} \\right) \\times 100$\n",

    "   - Example:\n",

    "   - Example:\n",
    "     Suppose a predicted answer contains $4$ correct words out of $5$ total words, but misses $2$ words that are in the ground truth answer. The precision would be $4/(4+1) = 0.8$, the recall would be $4/(4+2) = 0.67$, and the F1 Score would be $2 \\times (0.8 \\times 0.67)/(0.8 + 0.67) ≈ 0.73$.\n",

    "These metrics provide a nuanced view of the model's performance, offering insights into not only how often the model is correct (EM), but also how well it captures the nuances of the ground truth answers (F1 Score). Through these metrics, the evaluation phase aims to paint a comprehensive picture of the model's proficiency in the question-answering task amidst the structured framework provided by the SQuAD dataset."

    "In this section, we venture into the realm of adversarial evaluation to delve deeper into the abilities of the Llama-2 model. The objective is to scrutinize how the model responds to scenarios that are crafted to challenge its reasoning and retrieval capacities. We propose three methods to create adversarial datasets, each aimed at examining different facets of the model's behavior.\n",

    "1. **Answer Absence**: In this method, we modify the SQuAD dataset by crafting questions for which the answers do not exist in the provided context.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Entity Substitution**: Here, we substitute entity words in the context with other entities to test whether the model relies on retrieval or refers to the context accurately for answering the question. For instance, changing the context from \"The president of the USA lives in the White House. Barack Obama is the current president of the USA.\" to \"The president of the USA lives in the White House. Gall Granuaile is the current president of the USA.\" and observing if the answer changes appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Nonsense Word Substitution**: In this method, we replace certain words or entities with nonsensical words in a consistent and meaningful way, defining the nonsense words before asking the question. For example, replacing \"White House\" with \"Glibber House\" and explaining that \"Glibber\" means \"White\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Before embarking on the evaluation using adversarial datasets, we encourage students to ponder upon a few analytical questions:\n",
    "<font color=\"green\">\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is your expectation regarding the model's performance on these adversarial datasets?\n",
